## Oddjob SF Site

Not many web app features, but throwing in some server-rendered react for the hell of it.

### Getting Started

Just [clone](github-windows://openRepo/https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit) or
[fork](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/fork) the repo and start hacking:

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:SlexAxton/oddjobsf.git oddjobsf
$ cd oddjobsf
$ npm install                   # Install Node.js components listed in ./package.json
$ npm start                     # Compile and launch
```

### How to Build

```shell
$ npm run build                 # or, `npm run build -- release`
```

By default, it builds in a *debug* mode. If you need to build in a release
mode, just add `-- release` flag. This will optimize the output bundle for
production deployment.

### How to Run

```shell
$ npm start                     # or, `npm start -- release`
```

This will start a lightweight development server with "live reload" and
synchronized browsing across multiple devices and browsers.

### How to Deploy

Note: not yet true

```shell
$ npm run deploy                # or, `npm run deploy -- production`
```

For more information see `tools/deploy.js`.

### How to Test

Run unit tests powered by [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) with the following
[npm](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/misc/npm-scripts.html) command:

```shell
$ npm test
```

Test any javascript module by creating a `__tests__/` directory where
the file is. Name the test by appending `-test.js` to the js file.
[Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) will do the rest.
